Hi everyone! We've just shifted from the old CBL website to a github-based one to allow for easier collaboration and resource-sharing!

As there are several ongoing projects in the lab, we believe it will be more efficient in the long-run if everyone gets on board with updating the website, be it modifying your profile, adding new publications, or putting up recruitment calls for research participants - and hosting the website on GitHub will be the most optimal in achieving this.

We will soon have a quick crash course on the how-tos of GitHub but if you would like to to find out more information yourself on how to navigate GitHub, you can refer to the following links:
